# Milestone 2 Report

## Introduction
The main idea of our project targets to visualize the trends of music in time based on contemporary tastes.
In this visualization we aim to show: i) the trends of music production showing the most popular tracks per year investigating how their audio features affect the popularity; ii) the evolutions of genres in history, their main audio features, and popularity.

The website will be structure on a single page containing at least three interactive visualizations addressing music trends. In [Tools](#tools), we list the visualization tools we will use. The ideas are discussed in the [Minimal Viable Product](#minimal-viable-product) section. Additionally, we have ideas to add more interactions linking word usage in music history or a playable chart that allows reproducing the best song for each year. More details in [Extra Ideas](#extra-ideas).
